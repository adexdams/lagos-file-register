# Introduction
I spent 3+ years in the public sector within Folasade Adefisayo's office in Lagos State Government, Nigeria. There I observed a problem I desperately wanted to solve but couldn’t because it was beyond the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education.

The State’s filing system has lasted for generations, unfortunately, it is now a bottleneck in everyone’s operations. Hence, this is a proposed solution to solve that problem and transition the State’s longest-living system to a modern, digital, secure, and scalable system.

It is important to note, that this is not an official proposal but a demonstration of my thoughts and suggestions to solve the problem. It was developed according to my learnings at Questrom School of Business, Boston University, and Credit Karma and to showcase my ability to sit in a product manager position.
