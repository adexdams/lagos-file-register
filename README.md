# Introduction
The Lagos State Government runs on a system of paperwork that allows MDAs to pass information between one another, to document activities of its personnel, and to receive authorization for staff actions, initiatives and access to finance (i.e., everything official happens through it alone).

To make this possible, it employs two (2) registry personnel for each 945 sub-offices across MDAs, for the sole purpose of managing and entering identification data from files or memos collected and/or sent out into a logbook for reference.

Consequently, unpleasurable occurrences have been recorded in the process including files being misplaced between offices, difficulty in tracking files, duplication of efforts, malicious actors exploiting the process, and year-long productivity delays.

This demonstration was created to propose a solution for the above real-world problem as it occurred daily during my three (3) and half-year stints in the public sector.

## Problem Statement
The filing system in Lagos State Government has become a process flow deterrent. Everything hinges on a rigid paper-based register. As a result, a staffer spends 4 hours weekly to transfer a week-long content to an excel sheet so it can be shared and accurately indexed. When a file is misplaced, which happens often, it takes 4 days on average to track it.

The register is an integral part of government operations and digitizing its function alone, will increase the speed of documenting and tracking files, improve staff productivity, and reduce overhead costs.


## Proposed Solution
A simple digital ledger that identifies physical files or memos and gives it a digital footprint. It allows for a seamless and synchronized processing of files/ memos between 2 or more MDAs. These processing activities include the creation, recordkeeping, exchange & movement of files plus the collection, movement, and exchange of memos.

It is a **workflow management product** for Lagos State Government that unifies the authorization process across Offices, so the State can reduce its authorization timeline, reduce financial burdens and eliminate gate-keeper corruption.
